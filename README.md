Project Overview:
This C project demonstrates the use of union structures, which allow different data types to occupy the same memory space. The project highlights how unions can be used for efficient memory management and flexible data handling in C.

Key Features:

Union Implementation:

Basic Union: Implemented a simple union that can store an int, float, or char. Demonstrates how these types share the same memory location.
Complex Union: Created a more advanced union with multiple members and nested structures to show complex data handling.
Memory Management:

Efficient Storage: Showcases how unions can reduce memory usage by allowing different data types to share the same space.
Data Access: Provides methods to access and modify data within the union, ensuring correct usage and type safety.
Practical Examples:

Type Conversion: Demonstrates how to convert and reinterpret data stored in the union.
Flexible Data Handling: Illustrates scenarios where unions are useful, such as handling different data formats or types in a compact manner.
Error Handling:

Access Control: Manages issues related to accessing different data types within the same union, including proper initialization and validation.
User Interaction:

Command-line interface for testing union operations. Users can interact with the union structure to see how different types affect memory and data representation.
How to Run:

Compile the Code:

Use a C compiler to compile the source files. Example command: gcc -o union_example main.c UnionExample.c.
Execute the Program:

Run the compiled executable. Example command: ./union_example.
Interact with the Program:

Follow the prompts to test various union operations and observe how data is stored and accessed.
Dependencies:

C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
Standard C Library
